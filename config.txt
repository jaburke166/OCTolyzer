# For typical use case, leave settings below untouched (all set to 1)
# For debugging any unexpected errors, set robust_run to 0. 
# Otherwise, 1 will skip over any files which throw up unexpected error.

# Option to save out segmentation masks and raw images of .vol scan per individual.
save_individual_segmentations: 1
save_individual_images: 1

# This is to flag that you want to brighten the retinal and choroidal structures of an OCT B-scan
# and compensate for superficial retinal vessel shadowing
preprocess_bscans: 1

# By default, the choroid will be analysed. This is a flag to not save out choroid-related results
analyse_choroid: 1

# By default, the accompanying SLO image will be analysed, but this is a flag to toggle SLO analysis off/on (0/1)
analyse_slo: 1

# This is to specify specific retinal thickness map slabs, i.e. ILM_OPL, RNFL_PR1, etc. 
# Only valid for OCT Volume scans.
custom_maps: 0

# This flags that ALL inner retinal layer thickness maps will be computed. 
# Only valid for OCT Volume scans.
analyse_all_maps: 0

# By default, ETDRS grid will be measured for OCT Volume data. This is a flag for measuring a square 8x8 posterior pole grid.
# Only valid for OCT Volume scans.
analyse_square_grid: 0

# Option to measure choroid A-scan, column-wise (vertical) or locally perpendicular to 
# upper boundary (perpendicular)
# Only valid for OCT Volume and Linescan data
choroid_measure_type: vertical

# Distance either side of fovea to measure structures in H-line/V-line/Radial scans in microns, i.e. 500 microns, 3000 microns, etc.
# Only valid for OCT Linescan data, centred at the fovea (H-line/V-line/Radial)
